	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p><i>Even Punk Girls Blush</i> is a pogo-dancing game that celebrates life. 
	<p>The object is to slam the dancing punk girl into  
	walls while avoiding the hearts flying at her from behind and collecting broken ones along the way. 
	You move her by either pushing her with your finger or 
	by holding your mouse button down over her while dragging the mouse in the direction you want. You collect 
	broken hearts by passing the dancer across them.</p>
	<p>The game is 
	illuminated by paint that streaks across the screen. The streaks fade over time and are rejuvenated when she 
	bounces off an alternating wall. This means once she bounces off the right wall she must bounce off the left
	wall before she can bounce off the right one again.	The current wall she needs to hit is highlighted in a darker 
	color. A level fails when either a flying heart strikes her or the paint 
	completely fades. It also fails if there are any uncollected broken hearts at the end of a level.</p>
	<p>You earn points for wall bouncing, for each flying heart you avoid, for each broken one you collect, and 
	for reaching a new level. When a level fails you lose all points accumulated on that level. 
	You also lose points for idle time.</p>
	<p>Each level lasts 60 seconds, and on each succeeding level the game gets faster and more flying hearts are added.</p>
	<p>The game is fully functional but is still a WIP.</p>
