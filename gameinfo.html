	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p><i>Even Punk Girls Blush</i> lets you get your exercise and gaming on in one heart-throbbing motion-controlled action game. The object is to slam the pogo-dancing punk girl into walls while avoiding the hearts flying at her from behind and  collecting broken ones along the way.</p>
	<p>If you're using a desktop, you move the dancer sideways with either your left mouse button or left/right arrow keys. You collect broken hearts by passing the dancer over them and pushing her against the back wall by using either your right mouse button or up arrow key.</p>
	<p>If you have a mobile device, you can move the dancer sideways with your finger, and have her collect broken hearts by moving over them and tapping the screen with a second finger. You can also move her by swinging your hips in the desired direction; and, once over broken hearts, you can collect them by tapping the screen with two fingers at once.</p>
	<p>The game is 
	illuminated by paint that streaks across the screen. The streaks fade over time and are rejuvenated when she 
	bounces off an alternating wall. This means once she bounces off the right wall she must bounce off the left
	wall before she can bounce off the right one again.	The current wall she needs to hit is highlighted in a darker 
	color. A level fails when a flying heart strikes her or the paint 
	completely fades, and it also fails if you don't collect a broken heart by the time indicated below it.</p>
	<p>You earn points for wall bouncing, for each flying heart you avoid, for each broken one you collect, and 
	for reaching a new level. When a level fails you lose all points accumulated on that level.</p>
	<p>Each level lasts 60 seconds, and on each succeeding level the game gets harder, as more and more hearts are added.</p>
	<p>The game is fully functional but is still a WIP.</p>
